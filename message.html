         <h2>Message</h2>
          <p>I can still hardly believe I am writing this, and I am 
            very sorry to share the news that my dearly loved 
            husband, and wonderful father to Anna and Anthony, 
            passed away suddenly on Tuesday 3rd September towards 
            the end of our recent visit to Peru.  </p>

          <p>This summer we had the joy of attending a family 
            wedding in Poland (my nephew) and a family wedding 
            in Canada (Pete’s nephew). This meant we had a special 
            opportunity to spend time with both sides of the family. </p>

          <p>The trip to Canada enabled us to plan a follow-on 
            two-week trip to Peru. As many of you know Pete worked 
            in Peru in Christian faith based work and English 
            teaching for almost 14 years. This visit enabled us 
            to reconnect with many dear friends from those years, 
            hearing many encouraging updates on their journeys of 
            life and faith.  </p>

          <p>During the second week he developed health issues 
            which appeared to be minor, however, during the last 
            couple of days, he became much weaker and on admission 
            to A&E was found to have septicaemia, and this advanced 
            very rapidly and to my great shock he died by evening 
            of the day he was admitted. There are indications that 
            he suffered acute abdominal sepsis. </p>

          <p>Thankfully Anna and Anthony were able to join me in Peru
             within two days. Although it was hard to be so far away 
             from family and friends in the UK, we were supported 
             from afar and helped and comforted by many dear friends 
             locally. We decided it would be fitting to hold the 
             funeral and cremation in Trujillo where he spent many 
             happy and fulfilling years. Many of Pete’s close friends,
              who respected him greatly, attended with some taking 
              part in the funeral and speaking of how Pete had touched
               their lives.  </p>

          <p>We are now back in the UK and I am sorry that for some of 
            you this will be the first you have heard. Everything happened 
            so quickly. We are so grateful for many messages of love and 
            support.  </p>

          <p>Those who have heard have been asking about when and how
             we will mark Pete’s passing. We have settled on holding
              a thanksgiving service at Greyfriars Church where Pete
               was a member for 40 years. All are welcome. 
               Come in whatever you feel comfortable in. </p>

          <p>We as a family send you our love, <br \>
            Debbie, Anna, Anthony</p>
